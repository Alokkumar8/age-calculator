    <p>This age calculator determines a person's age based on their date of birth. Age calculation methods can vary across cultures, but generally, a person's age is incremented by 1 year on each birthday.</p>

    <p>This free online age calculator is a valuable and straightforward tool applicable in numerous scenarios. It can determine the age of individuals ranging from newborns to seniors by computing years, months, and days, using input of their birthdate and the current date.</p>
    
    <div id="calc">
    <h2>What does an Age Calculator do?</h2>
    </div>
    
    <p><strong>Online age calculator is a web-based tool</strong> designed to calculate a person's age on a specific date, provided their date of birth (dob) is known. In many Western cultures, the age calculation typically rounds down, so if a person has lived for 8 years and 9 months, their age is considered 8 years.</p>
    
    <h3>Date of Birth (DOB) Calculator</h3>
    
    <p>Date of birth DOB calculator enables us to determine age based on the date of birth. To utilize this agecalculator, input the required values into the provided input box.</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>DOB in the form of DD/MM/YYYY</li>
        <li>The specific date for which you wish to calculate the age should be entered in the same format as dd/mm/yyyy</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Formula for Age Calculator</h2>
    </div>
    
    <p>According to the Oxford Dictionary, &ldquo;Age&rdquo; refers to the duration of a person&#39;s life or the existence of an object. Calculating age involves comparing a person&#39;s date of birth with the date for which the age is required. Subtracting the date of birth from the given date yields the person&#39;s age, represented by the formula: Age = Given date - Date of birth. Below are the steps to calculate a person's age from their date of birth to a specified date.</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Initially, calculate the total number of complete years by subtracting the birth year from the current year. For instance, if the current year is 2024 and the birth year is 1998, the count of full years is 26.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Subsequently, determine the count of complete months by subtracting the birth month from the <a href="https://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095355563">current month</a>. If the current month is earlier than the birth month, reduce the count of full years by 1 and add 12 to the current month to adjust. Then, calculate the difference (current month - birth month). For instance, if the birth month is February and the current month is April, the total months count is 2. If the birth month is November and the current month is April, the total months count is 4 + 12 = 16, and the difference is 16 - 11 = 5.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Similar to previous step, we also determine the count of days by subtracting the birth date from the current date. However, if the current date is earlier than the birth date, we subtract 1 from the count of full months and add 30/31/28/29 to the current date, depending on the number of days in the previous month preceding the current month.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> In conclusion, the age calculator gives the age in days, months and years.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Examples Showing How to Calculate Age</h2>
    
    <p>Below are examples illustrating how to calculate age and the methodology employed by the birthday calculator for clearer understanding.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Example 1:</strong> John's date of birth is July 25, 1985 (25/07/1985). Determine his age on January 28, 2021, and validate it using the age calculator.</p>
    






<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
    
<p>Applying the formula to calculate John's age:</p>
    
<p>Age of a Person = Given date - Date of birth.</p>
    
<p>John's Date of Birth = July 25, 1985.</p>
    
<p>Given date = January 28, 2021.</p>
    
<p>Note that the current month is less than the birth month. That is, January (1) is less than July (7). Therefore, we consider the year 2020 as the current year and also account for 12 + 1 (Jan) - 7 (July) = 6 months.</p>
    
<p>Years' Difference = 2020 - 1985 = 35 years.</p>
    
<p>Number of remaining days = 3 days.</p>
    
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Hence, John's age is 35 years, 6 months, and 3 days.</p>
    
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong> Peter's date of birth is July 13, 1992. Calculate his age on April 21, 2016, and confirm it using the age calculator.</p>
    
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
    
<p>Utilizing the formula to calculate Peter's age:</p>
    
<p>Age of a Person = Present date - Date of birth.</p>
    
<p>Here is a slightly different approach to grasp the age formula more clearly.</p>
    
<p>Peter's Date of Birth = July 13, 1992.</p>
    
<p>Years' Difference = 2015 - 1992 = 23 years. (This calculation extends from July 13, 1992, to July 13, 2015).</p>
    
<p>Number of remaining months from July 13, 2015, to April 13, 2016 = 9 months.</p>
    
<p>Number of remaining days from April 13, 2016, to April 21, 2016 = 8 days.</p>
    
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Therefore, Peter's age is 23 years, 9 months, and 8 days.</p>
    
<p>Similarly, you can employ the age calculator to ascertain the ages of individuals with the birth dates and current dates provided until August 26, 2021:</p>
    
<ul>
    <li>July 13, 1992</li>
    <li>April 21, 2016</li>
</ul>
